    I’m passionate and constantly thinking about the hardware that will drive tomorrow’s AI.
    My research builds abstractions that move data <strong> to the right place at the right 
    time through the right route </strong> across massive parallel and heterogeneous hardware systems. 
    My current work focuses on specialized streaming acceleration, 
    bridging <strong> compilers </strong> and <strong> computer architecture</strong>, for AI workloads on AI-specialized dataflow hardware like NPUs and FPGAs. 
    In parallel, 
    I’m exploring how AI can help generate high‑performance code and shorten chip‑design cycles, 
    aiming at a virtuous cycle: <strong> hardware for AI, and AI for hardware</strong>. 

  </p>
  </p>
    I believe in reconfigurable computing and high‑level synthesis. 
    I am honored to be advised by Prof. 
    <a href="https://vast.cs.ucla.edu/people/faculty/jason-cong" target="_blank">Jason Cong</i></a>
    at UCLA. 
    During my M.S. at CMU, I was fortunate to delve into stream and dataflow 
    architectures with Prof. <a href="https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~jhoe/doku/doku.php?id=home" 
    target="_blank">James C. Hoe</i></a>. 
    I received dual bachelor’s degrees from Zhejiang University and UIUC, 
    where I did undergrad thesis on HLS abstractions and compilers with Prof. 
    <a href="https://dchen.ece.illinois.edu/" target="_blank">Deming Chen</i></a>.
